Adds enhanced "go to declaration" support for Gradle typesafe (and not typesafe) accessors. Instead of going to the generated code, you will jump directly to the place which is semantically referenced.

Supported:
* subproject references
* precompiled script plugin references

The plugin is available in JetBrains marketplace: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24207-gradle-jumper
